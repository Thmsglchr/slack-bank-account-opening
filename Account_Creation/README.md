## Running Your Project Locally

While building your app, you can see your changes propagated to your workspace
in real-time with `slack run`. In both the CLI and in Slack, you'll know an app
is the development version if the name has the string `(local)` appended.

```zsh
# Run app locally
$ slack run

Connected, awaiting events
```

To stop running locally, press `<CTRL> + C` to end the process.

## Deploying Your App

Once you're done with development, you can deploy the production version of your
app to Slack hosting using `slack deploy`:

```zsh
$ slack deploy
```

After deploying, create a trigger for the production version of your app (not
appended with `(local)`). Once the trigger is invoked, the workflow should run
just as it did when developing locally.

## Project Structure

### `manifest.ts`

The [app manifest](https://api.slack.com/automation/manifest) contains the app's
configuration. This file defines attributes like app name and description.

### `slack.json`

Used by the CLI to interact with the project's SDK dependencies. It contains
script hooks that are executed by the CLI and implemented by the SDK.

### `Account_Creation/functions`

[Functions](https://api.slack.com/automation/functions) are reusable building
blocks of automation that accept inputs, perform calculations, and provide
outputs. Functions can be used independently or as steps in workflows.

### `Account_Creation/workflows`

A [workflow](https://api.slack.com/automation/workflows) is a set of steps that
are executed in order. Each step in a workflow is a function.

Workflows can be configured to run without user input, or they can collect
inputs by beginning with a [form](https://api.slack.com/automation/forms) before
continuing to the next step.
